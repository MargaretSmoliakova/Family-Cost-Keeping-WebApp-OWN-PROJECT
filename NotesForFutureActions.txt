FamilyCostKeeping (current state):

- why my EF code first is not correct (regarding related objects)???????
- create base authorization and authentification so that it won't be possible to authentication to this page without userId in the db;
- correct UserServices methods in the area of current user (get UserId f.ex);
- think how to get object's nested objects in a better way;
- create connection between models and view's components;
- think how to initialize Repositories on creation of unirOfWork object by DI;
