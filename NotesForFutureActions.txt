- improve cookies settings, espesially protection, and think about cookies access (how to protect info - create and save encrypted key for every user into cookie and save it into db) so change userId info access from cookie in the program;
- get local DateTime info or local zone from user (think how) to do the next task;
- correct GetDaysOfCurrentMonthLeft method of the UserServices;
- why my EF code first is not correct (regarding related objects)???????;

- create connection between models and view's components (main page);
- create functionality for the binded components and services;

- should I save only the userId in the cookies;
- should I save login and password in the cookies and authenticate user and using this info;
- should I get userId usign userId from cookies or also using login and password;
- correct outgoing URL from [Authorize] attribute to the Authentication controller (bad URL: .../Authentication?ReturnUrl=%2F vs normal URL: .../Authentication);

- add main general page for unauthenticated users (general app info);
