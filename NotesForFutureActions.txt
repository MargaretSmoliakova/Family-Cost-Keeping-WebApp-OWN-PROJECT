- why my EF code first is not correct (regarding related objects)??????? or is it incorrect? how can I get related objects or do I need this;
- improve cookies settings, espesially protection, and think about cookies access (how to protect info - create and save encrypted key for every user into cookie and save it into db) so change userId info access from cookie in the program;
- create connection between models and view's components (main page);
- create functionality for the binded components and services;

- correct outgoing URL from [Authorize] attribute to the Authentication controller (bad URL: .../Authentication?ReturnUrl=%2F vs normal URL: .../Authentication);

- add main general page for unauthenticated users (general app info);
- add admin functions (with authentication);
