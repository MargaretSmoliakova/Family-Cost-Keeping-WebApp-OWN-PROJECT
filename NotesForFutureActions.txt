FamilyCostKeeping (current state):

- why my EF User's collection return null at any situation (correct the EF relationship) and read about lazy loading;
- can I create code first EF so that I can return all connected objects with the entity;
- create tests for current UserRepository
- create base authorization and authentification;
- correct UserServices methods in the area of current user (get UserId f.ex);
- think how to get object's nested objects in a better way;
- create connection between models and view's components;
- think how to initialize Repositories on creation of unirOfWork object by DI;
