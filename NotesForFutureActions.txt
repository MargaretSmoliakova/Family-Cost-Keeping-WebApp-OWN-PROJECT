FamilyCostKeeping (current state):

- improve cookies settings, espesially protection, and think about cookies access (how to protect info - create and save encrypted key for every user into cookie and save it into db) so change userId info access from cookie in the program;
- create tests for controllers with "return View(object)" to test object;
- get localTimeZone of the user;
- add settings page with the current info about user and ability to change it;
- create connection between models and view's components (main page);
- create functionality for the binded components and services;
- think whether I need all these repos and services;

- correct outgoing URL from [Authorize] attribute to the Authentication controller (bad URL: .../Authentication?ReturnUrl=%2F vs normal URL: .../Authentication);

- add main general page for unauthenticated users (general app info);
- add admin functions (with authentication);
- add friends users for the current user;

- create normal UI;
